# Image Classifier Using VGG16 and ResNet50

This project is part of the **"AI Capstone Project with Deep Learning"** course on Coursera by IBM. The goal of this project is to build an image classifier using the pre-trained VGG16 model, evaluate its performance, and compare it with the ResNet50 model built earlier in the course.

## Project Overview

This notebook demonstrates how to:
- Load and preprocess image data.
- Use the VGG16 pre-trained model to classify images.
- Train and evaluate the classifier.
- Compare the results of the VGG16 model with the ResNet50 model.
